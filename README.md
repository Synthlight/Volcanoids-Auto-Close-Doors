# Volcanoids Auto-Close-Doors Mod
This is a mod to automatically close doors players open, automatically, a few seconds later.

# Requirements
- Volcanoids obviously.
- BepInEx: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx (You want the x64 version.)

# Installation
- Extract BepInEx to the root Volcanoids folder so `winhttp.dll` is in the same folder as `Volcanoids.exe`.
- Extract this mod so `Auto-Sort.dll` is placed like this: `Volcanoids\BepInEx\plugins\Auto-Close-Doors.dll`.

# Un-installation
BepInEx uses `winhttp.dll` as an injector/loader. Renaming or deleting this file is enough to disable both my mod and the loader.
